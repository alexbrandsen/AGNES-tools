component pieces  - in here it has sections of code that might be useful on their own. 
			- jsonl2pos-and-bio - convert jsonl files to POS and bio
			- Text split for multiple documents - this splits the code into a set percentage if there are multiple files and outputs them combined. 
			- TSV converter - to convert TSV to CSV
			- English-dont change anything - just for running tests - this is the origional code. Made to ensure that I always have a backup of it. Few issues such as printing the label, but its not too bad
